A console-based Library Management System implemented in C++ (OOP).  
This project demonstrates a simple, modular design for managing books, users, and borrowing records with separate admin and user roles.

## Features
- Admin functionality:
  - Add, delete and update books
  - Search books by ID or title or category
  - View all borrowed books and borrowers
- User functionality:
  - Register and sign in
  - Search and browse available books
  - Borrow books (quantity tracked) and view return date
- Borrowing management:
  - Records borrower email, borrow date and calculated return date
- Simple file-based persistence (books.txt, users.txt, borrowed.txt)
- Clean project structure: include/, src/, data/ (or similar)
